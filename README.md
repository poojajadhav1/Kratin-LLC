<h3>Problem Statement : How can you help Sunita Sharma (65+ years old) to live a healthier and better life?</h3>

<h3>IDEA<h3>
We know that 65+ year old women have some kind of issue like blood pressure . that's why we have to know about sunita's past history i.e her blood pressure level, sugar level, cholesterol level and chest pain type . By using this past history ,we predict the accurate health and guidance for sunita 
For past history or recent history we take a bp, cholesterol, chest pain ,age , sugar level etc values as input from user and from that values we predict Sunita's health. 
I used the dataset for this problem statement and worked on that dataset for better results. By applying the machine learning algorithm on the dataset , I get the accurate health of that person/sunita . And after the recognition of health I will suggest her the proper guidelines
1 test case :If sunita has high BP high cholesterol and high sugar then she is suffering from heart disease and she needs a check up . Also if she goes through the proper diet and exercise which is mentioned in the web app then that is good for her.for example sunita has high BP level then she needs a proper diet where she is not including salt in her food.

2 test case: if sunita has normal health then she need a mentioned guidelines for further healthier life which is mentioned on web application, Like what type of diet she needs to follow. Which exercises are good for her. 

This is the overall idea for sunita's healthier life which is implemented by using python, machine learning ,streamlit and data science
